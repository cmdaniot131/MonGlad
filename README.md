This is a text based game that took references from Monster Hunter World. Its battle system specifically took chunks of ideas from the Arena Quests that the player can take in the game.

The project took many versions to complete, started from scrapping versions that doesn't make the program ran as I want it to be to getting my game get its final updated glory.
The Final version of my game can be seen from the [BEST CODE VERSION] folder, feel free to look at my scrapped versions too.
